# Series02-RStudio: Correlations and Statistical Tests
This repository aims at several goals.

The first goal is to manage different types of data sets.

The second goal is to understand the variables, and then to visualize and analyze them accordingly.

The third goal is to critically assess the validity of our analyzes, keeping in mind their meanings and limits in the real world.

To complete these purposes, we are answering at a questions sheet in the form of a RMarkdown notebook.
